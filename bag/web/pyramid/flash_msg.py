"""Advanced flash messages scheme for Pyramid.

This module integrates :py:mod:`bag.web.flash_msg` into Pyramid.
(That module can be used with any web framework.)

Why?
====

It is natural to have a single class that knows:

- the content of a flash message in either plain or rich form(s)
- the kind (color) of the message, such as info, danger, success etc.
- different ways of rendering the message on the page
- whatever else you want.

The queue problem
=================

Some Pyramid applications have used flash message queues to separate
them by level (danger, warning, info or success) in code such as this::

    request.session.flash(str(e), 'danger')

The problem with this is that messages won't appear in the order in which
they were created. Because each queue is processed separately in the
template, order is lost and messages are grouped by kind.
This is undesirable and confusing to the user.

Our solution stores the level *with* the message, so you can add all
messages to the default queue and process only that queue in templates.

Installation
============

At web server startup time, add this simple line::

    config.include('bag.web.pyramid.flash_msg')

Usage
=====

Add messages to the queue like this::

    request.add_flash(
        plain="Your password has been changed, thanks.",
        kind='warning',
        close=False,  # user will NOT see an X button to close the alert
        allow_duplicate=False,  # do not bother the user with repeated text
        )

Then you can simply do, in templates:

    ${render_flash_messages()}

...to render the messages with Bootstrap styling.
The Jinja2 version is ``{{ render_flash_messages() | safe }}``.

If you don't like the result in any way, just loop over the flash messages
yourself and do what you want -- no need to use this feature.
