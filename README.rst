bag library
===========

**bag** contains code for many purposes, which I find myself reusing in
multiple programs -- so this code must be version-controlled.
I use SQLAlchemy and Pyramid a lot.

**Documentation** is at http://docs.nando.audio/bag/latest/

The library, tested on Python 3.4 and 3.5, is hosted at
https://github.com/nandoflorestan/bag
where you can do your bug reports and pull requests.

- bag 0.8.0 is the last version that supported Python 2.6.
- bag 0.9.0 is the last version that supported Python 2.7.
  Many modules probably still work with Python 2.7, but I do not intend to
  bother testing on Python 2 anymore.

This version of **bag** was published with
`releaser <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/releaser>`_.
